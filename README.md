# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

This repo is about the skills required for managing and delivering robust software systems by focussing on the foundation of successful development: requirement analysis.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

It is the stage at which the team collects, analyses, and defines what the software should do. A clear and thorough requirement analysis ensures that all stakeholders share a common understanding of the project's goals, features, and expectations, laying the groundwork for successful development.


## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement analysis is essential for any successful software project. It promotes clarity and alignment among stakeholders by defining expectations. It helps define the project's scope, preventing scope creep, and serves as the foundation for design and development. Additionally, it enables accurate estimation of cost, resources, and timeline, while supporting better quality assurance throughout the project lifecycle.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.

- Requirement gathering. 
Interviews and workshops with stakeholders are conducted to gather information about the needs and expectations of those for whom the software is being developed. Surveys/questionnaires are also distributed to a larger audience to gather requirements. This stage involves observing end users to understand their needs and reviewing existing documents. 


- Requirement elicitation.
 Brainstorming sessions are used to generate ideas and collect requirements. During this phase, prototypes are created to assist stakeholders in visualising the system and refining their requirements. 


- Requirement documentation 
In this section, a specific document is created that lists all functional and non-functional requirements, as well as user stories that describe functionality from the perspective of the user. Use case diagrams are also generated. 

- Requirement analysis and modelling.
The requirements are prioritised based on their importance and impact on the project. The feasibility of requirements is also evaluated in terms of technical, financial, and time constraints, while models are created to visualise and analyse requirements. 

- Requirement validation. 
Reviewing the document requirements with stakeholders to ensure their accuracy and completeness. Define clear acceptance criteria for each requirement.


## Types of Requirements.

### Functional reqirement
This describe what a system or software should do like user registration and authentication, property listing and property search.


### Non-functional requirement
This describe how the system should perform like peformance, scalabilty, security, usability.


## Use Case Diagrams.
Use case diagrams show how different users (actors) interact with the system to achieve specific goals (use cases).
