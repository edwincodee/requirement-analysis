# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

This repo is about the skills required for managing and delivering robust software systems by focussing on the foundation of successful development: requirement analysis.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

It is the stage at which the team collects, analyses, and defines what the software should do. A clear and thorough requirement analysis ensures that all stakeholders share a common understanding of the project's goals, features, and expectations, laying the groundwork for successful development.


## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement analysis is essential for any successful software project. It promotes clarity and alignment among stakeholders by defining expectations. It helps define the project's scope, preventing scope creep, and serves as the foundation for design and development. Additionally, it enables accurate estimation of cost, resources, and timeline, while supporting better quality assurance throughout the project lifecycle.
